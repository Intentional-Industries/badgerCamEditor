# Badger Cam Editor

## Hi Morgan 

To run this I think you need to...

```bash

python3 -m venv bagerCamEditor

cd badgerCamEditor

source bagerCamEditor/bin/activate

git clone https://github.com/Intentional-Industries/badgerCamEditor.git

cd badgerCamEditor

mkdir input_directory output_directory segment_directory processed_directory

pip install ultralytics

mkdir video-src

mkdir video-destination


```

then just run the main.py script and hide behind your wall incase your lap top blows up
