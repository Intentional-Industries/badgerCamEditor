# Badger Can Editor

## Hi Morgan 

To run this I think you need to...

```bash

python3 -m venv bagerCamEditor

source bagerCamEditor/bin/activate

mkdir src

cd src

pip install ultralytics

mkdir video-src

mkdir video-destination


```

then just run the main.py script and hide behind your wall incase your lap top blows up
